ZeroReserve
===========

Friend 2 Friend Payment and Bitcoin exchange

Prerequisite for building:
* RetroShare build and 
* sqlite3 and 
* libbitcoin.

RetroShare is available from http://retroshare.sourceforge.net/.

sqlite3 is probably part of your Linux distribution. If you are on Windows,
get it from http://www.sqlite.org/

Get libbitcoin directly from git because the release doesn't have support for TestNet.
$ git clone https://github.com/spesmilo/libbitcoin.git

Then configure with
$ ./configure.ac --enable-leveldb --enable-testnet

To build ZeroReserve, checkout the sources to the plugins directory of Retroshare and build with

$ qmake && make clean && make

To install on Windows, drop the resulting DLL into the
%APPDATA%\Retroshare\extensions directory.

To install on Linux or MacOS, drop the resulting shared object into
~/.retroshare/extensions


This is experimental software. Use at your own risk. 

At this stage, leave TestNet on. 

Don't enable real currencies.

Building and running on MacOS may or may not work at this point.
